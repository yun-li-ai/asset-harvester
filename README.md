### Abstract

Closed-loop simulation is a core component of autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling scalable testing, training, and safety validation before real-world deployment. Neural scene reconstruction converts driving logs into interactive 3D environments for simulation, but it does not produce complete 3D object assets required for agent manipulation and large-viewpoint novel-view synthesis.
To address this challenge, we present Asset Harvester, an image-to-3D model and end-to-end pipeline that converts sparse, in-the-wild object observations from real driving logs into complete, simulation-ready assets.
Rather than relying on a single model component, we developed a system-level design for real-world AV data that combines large-scale curation of object-centric training tuples, geometry-aware preprocessing across heterogeneous sensors, and a robust training recipe that couples sparse-view-conditioned multiview generation with 3D Gaussian lifting. Within this system, SparseViewDiT is explicitly designed to address limited-angle views and other real-world data challenges.
Together with hybrid data curation, augmentation, and self-distillation, this system enables scalable conversion of sparse AV object observations into reusable 3D assets.

**Asset Harvester** turns real-world driving logs into complete, simulation-ready 3D assets — from just one or a few in-the-wild object views. It handles vehicles, pedestrians, riders, and other road objects, even under heavy occlusion, noisy calibration, and extreme viewpoint bias. A multiview diffusion model generates consistent novel viewpoints, and a feed-forward Gaussian reconstructor lifts them to full 3D in seconds. The result: high-fidelity 3D Gaussian splat assets ready for insertion into simulation environments. The pipeline plugs directly into NVIDIA NCore and NuRec for scalable data ingestion and closed-loop simulation.

## Pipeline Overview

NCore V4 Data ─► NCore Parsing ─► Multiview Diffusion + Gaussian Lifting ─► [`metadata.yaml`](docs/end_to_end_example.md#step-3-generate-external-assets-metadata-to-use-with-nvidia-omniverse-nurec-optional) (required for NuRec Object Insertion)

## User Guide

For end-to-end asset harvesting from recorded driving sessions, see our  <b>[Full End-to-End Workflow](docs/end_to_end_example.md)</b> :sparkles: !

<details>
<summary><b>Setup</b></summary>

#### Prerequisites

- **conda** (Miniconda or Miniforge)
- **NVIDIA driver** >= 570 (CUDA 12.8 compatible)
- **GCC** 10–13 (tested with GCC 12.3)
- **GPU VRAM** ~16 GB (add `--offload` to offload unused models to CPU for lower VRAM)

> **Note:** Initial setup takes ~20 minutes to complete.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/asset-harvester.git
cd asset-harvester
bash setup.sh
conda activate asset-harvester
```

Options: `bash setup.sh --env-name asset-harvester --python 3.10`

#### Download Model Checkpoints

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub[cli]
hf auth login
hf download nvidia/asset-harvester --local-dir checkpoints
```
or, manually from the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/asset-harvester).
This places the following files in `checkpoints/`:

```
checkpoints/
├── AH_multiview_diffusion.safetensors
├── AH_tokengs_lifting.safetensors
├── AH_camera_estimator.safetensors
└── AH_object_seg_jit.pt
```

Try Asset Harvester on our sample data (Multiview Diffusion + Gaussian Lifting).
Requires ~16GB VRAM. If you run into VRAM OOM issues, add `--offload_model_to_cpu` to offload unused model components to CPU:

```bash
export DATA_ROOT=data_samples/rectified_AV_objects/
export CHECKPOINT_MV=checkpoints/AH_multiview_diffusion.safetensors
export CHECKPOINT_GS=checkpoints/AH_tokengs_lifting.safetensors
export OUTPUT_DIR=outputs/harvesting
python3 run_inference.py \
    --diffusion_checkpoint "${CHECKPOINT_MV}" \
    --data_root "${DATA_ROOT}" \
    --output_dir "${OUTPUT_DIR}" \
    --lifting_checkpoint "${CHECKPOINT_GS}"
```

Or if you have a single-view image with an object in the center and a foreground mask, resize them into 512x512, and place them in a folder with this structure:

```
YOUR_IMAGE_ROOT/
├─── YOUR_IMAGE_NAME_0
│    ├── frame.jpeg
│    └── mask.png
└─── YOUR_IMAGE_NAME_1
...
```

If masks are not available, you can also use our image segmentation model to
 get mask.png from frame.jpeg stored in above structure:

```bash
export CHECKPOINT_SEG=checkpoints/AH_object_seg_jit.pt
export IMAGE_ROOT=data_samples/segmented_images 
python utils/image_segment.py \
  --checkpoint $CHECKPOINT_SEG \
  --image_folder $IMAGE_ROOT \
  --frame_name frame.jpeg \
  --mask_name mask.png
```

Check the folder `data_samples/OOD_images` for example.

After data preparation, run Asset Harvester with our built-in camera estimator:

```bash
export YOUR_IMAGE_ROOT=data_samples/OOD_images
export CHECKPOINT_MV=checkpoints/AH_multiview_diffusion.safetensors
export CHECKPOINT_GS=checkpoints/AH_tokengs_lifting.safetensors
export CHECKPOINT_CAM=checkpoints/AH_camera_estimator.safetensors
export OUTPUT_DIR=outputs/harvesting_with_camera_estimate
python3 run_inference.py \
    --diffusion_checkpoint "${CHECKPOINT_MV}" \
    --ahc_checkpoint "${CHECKPOINT_CAM}" \
    --image_dir "${YOUR_IMAGE_ROOT}" \
    --output_dir "${OUTPUT_DIR}" \
    --lifting_checkpoint  "${CHECKPOINT_GS}"
```
